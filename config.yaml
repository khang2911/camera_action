# YOLO Model Configuration
# Multiple engines can be configured, each frame will go through all engines
models:
  - path: "/path/to/yolo_engine1.engine"  # Path to TensorRT engine file
    num_detectors: 4                      # Number of detector threads for this engine
    name: "model1"                        # Optional: name identifier for output files
    type: "detection"                     # Model type: "detection" or "pose"
  - path: "/path/to/yolo_engine2.engine"
    num_detectors: 4
    name: "model2"
    type: "detection"
  - path: "/path/to/yolo_pose.engine"     # YOLO Pose model
    num_detectors: 4
    name: "pose_model"
    type: "pose"                          # Pose model outputs keypoints

# Video Sources
videos:
  list_file: "./video_list.txt"  # Path to text file containing video paths (one per line)

# Thread Configuration
threads:
  num_readers: 10      # Number of reader/preprocessor threads (CPU)

# Output Configuration
output:
  dir: "./output"      # Output directory for binary result files
